The project with dependencies is installed by running
```
pip install .
```
in the ```/project_3``` folder. All following guides assumes you are located in this folder (paths are relative to this folder).

Current test status:

[![FYS-STK4155 Project "](https://github.com/GauteJ1/FYS-STK-projects/actions/workflows/test3.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GauteJ1/FYS-STK-projects/actions/workflows/test3.yml)

All unit tests are located in ```src/tests.py```. They can be executed by:
```
pytest src/tests.py
```
Note that the initial installation of the project also includes the pytest package, hence no manual installation of this package will be needed in order to run this command.

A three-dimensional grid search over the number of hidden layers, the size of them and the activation functions for the hidden layers can be run from ```grid_search.py``` (located in the ```src/``` folder). The grid search is run by:
```
python grid_search.py grid
```

Additional one-dimensional grid searches over each of the three hyperparameters can be run by:
```
python grid_search.py activations
python grid_search.py value_layers
python grid_search.py n_layers
```

If no command line argument is specified when running ```grid_search.py```, the program will run all four grid searches.
The results are saved to the ```results/``` folder.

Plots are produced from ```plots.py``` (located in ```src/```). The plots are generated by:
```
python plots.py time boxplots heatmaps
```
One can produce only some of the plots at a time by specifying the desired plot as one of the three command line arguments. The plots are saved in the ```plots/``` folder.

<!-- 

All plots in the final report are generated in ```explorations/exploring_logreg.ipynb``` and ```explorations/exploring_nn.ipynb```. All numbers and results provided in the report can also be found in these files. Both these files are jupyter notebook files. Make sure to install the project as described before trying to run these files. The figures from these files are saved in ```figures/```.

The main code structure is located in the ```src/``` folder, while som intermediate code including weekly assignments are stored in ```weekly_assignments```.
The code for exploring the different neural networks is located in the ```explorations/``` folder.

All latex code for generating the delivered PDF document is located in the ```text/``` folder, as well as the files ```main.tex```, ```config.tex``` and ```References.bib``` in the main project 2 folder. -->
