In an increasingly data-driven world, precise models are of paramount importance.
As the demand for models of complex data has increased, the need for developing stable efficient and accurate models of real world data is at an all time high.

Partial differential equations (PDEs) represent a way to mathematically describe the relation between the values and rate of change of complex systems.
While PDEs may be most known within physics and mechanics, where they are derived from theory, they are also prevalent within other applications.
Both within macro-economics \cite{ecoPDE} and epidemiology, such as modeling the spread of COVID-19 \cite{covidus}, PDEs play a large role in describing
