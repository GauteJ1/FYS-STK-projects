Inferring from our experiments, we have the general impression that finite difference schemes slightly outperform physics-informed neural networks. 
We experience that more complex approximation methods are needed to accurately model the system described by the PDE; the finite difference method performing better for a more finely granulated range, and the neural network improving for increasing complexity to a certain point. 

In our analysis both aforementioned methods perform considerably well compared with an exact analytical solution, the finite difference method slightly outperforming the neural network. 
The fact that the finite difference method provides a more intuitive approach, and requires less computational power is also to be taken into consideration.

It should be noted that in practical applications the neural network would likely be provided additional data to be trained on, possibly leading to a network outperforming a finite difference scheme. In this case one might still prefer the finite difference scheme, depending on computational cost and interpretability. 


We conclude that finite difference schemes are preferred over physics-informed neural networks, given that the full equation, and sufficient initial and boundary conditions for the problem, are available.
