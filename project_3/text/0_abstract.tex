We have used the finite difference method and Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to numerically solve the one-dimensional heat equation. 
We find that the finite difference method outperforms the neural network. 
Its MSE compared to the analytical solution is $2.52 \times 10^{-7}$, whereas the neural network achieves $ 6.71 \times 10^{-6}$.
