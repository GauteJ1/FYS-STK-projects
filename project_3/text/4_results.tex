The results from the finite difference method and the NN are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps}.
The outputs from the models have been interpolated for the plots. \gaute{more}
There is no noticeable difference by eye between any of the three.  
This is well reflected in the very low MSE-value for both methods. 
Compared to the analytical solution, the output of the neural network model has an MSE of $ 6.71 \times 10^{-6}$ while the finite difference method yields an MSE of $2.52 \times 10^{-7}$. 
Since the two methods utilize different discretizations of the $(x,t)$ grid, the analytical solution is evaluated only at the respective grid points of each method. 
Consequently, the MSE calculation for the neural network involves a greater number of points than that of the finite difference method.

We \textit{"slice"} the heatmaps in Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps} at two specific times, $t = 0.03 s$ and $t = 0.25 s$. 
This is illustrated as blue lines in Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps}.
The resulting temperature values across the x-range are plotted for all three cases in Fig. \ref{fig:timeslices}.
\mia{something about the choice of the two times, ref the assignment}
This serves as an additional verification of the previously presented results. 
The finite difference method seems to match the analytical solution perfectly \mia{strong word?}.
The NN however, is slightly undershooting. 
The effect of this is more prominent for the later time stamp $t = 0.25 s$. 
These results reflect well the lower MSE for the finite difference method compared to the NN. 
\mia{The reason for this might be: }


\mia{Additionally, the finite difference method with 100 points along the x-axis is plotted to illustrate what???}

\mia{why is N = 10 and N = 100 equally good for fd?}


The results from the in-depth investigation of the impact of the hyperparameters \textit{number of hidden layers}, the \textit{size of the hidden layers}, and the \textit{activation functions} are presented in Figs. \ref{fig:boxplots_activations}, \ref{fig:boxplots_size_of_layers} and \ref{fig:boxplots_number_of_hidden_layers} respectively. 
From the three-dimensional grid search, the best values were found to be three hidden layers with size 50 and tanh as the activation function.

As activation functions, sigmoid and tanh outperform ReLU and leakyReLU.
