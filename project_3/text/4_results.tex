The results from the finite difference method and the NN are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps}.
Compared to the analytical solution, the output of the neural network model has a MSE of $ 3.41 \times 10^{-5}$ while the finite difference method yields a MSE of $2.52 \times 10^{-7}$
Looking at the respective methods output in Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps}, their is no noticeable difference by eye between any of the three.  
This is well reflected in the very low MSE-value for both methods.

The discretization along the x-axis is different for each method. The analytical one is plotted with 1000 points, the finite difference method with 10 points and the neural network predictions with 100.
