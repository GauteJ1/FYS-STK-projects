From our experiments, we have the general impression that neural netwroks are performing better than the classical regression methods.
Especially in the regression problem on the Franke function data, neural networks excel in comparison to linear regression.
We observe that while the linear regression models struggle to grasp the structure of the data, the neural networks seems to make accurate prediction, achieving an $R^2$ value of 0.77 which is very good considering the large amounts of noise included in the data set.
We experience that relatively shallo
