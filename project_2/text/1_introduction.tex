Our society has grown gradually more data-driven in the last decades, and the number of important systems and decisions which are ran by data models is only increasing.
Neural networks, being large adaptive machine learning models able to use large amounts of data to make accurate predictions, have rapidly moved from being a theoretical niche into being in the front of everybody's minds.
They are currently the cause of revolutionary changes within a wide range of fields, including healthcare, finance, education and transportation.

Even though they have been made popular in recent years, neural networks is not a new concept.
The idea of making computational models inspired by neurons in the brain originates in a paper by
