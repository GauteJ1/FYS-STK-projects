We implement linear regression models, including ordinary least squares regression, Ridge and Lasso, in order to explore their predicative abilities both compared to each other, and relative to their respective adjustable parameters. 
Using both manufactured data from the Franke function as well as real terrain data from the U.S. Geological Survey. 
We also explore the concept of bias-variance trade off in the models, using resampling methods such as bootstrapping and k-fold cross-validation. 
We conclude by reiterating the importance of selecting appropriate model complexities and values for model parameters, and suggest some guidance values for the relevant models and types of data. \gaute{must look over}
